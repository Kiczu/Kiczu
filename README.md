👋 Hi, my name is Adrian. I am a Junior React Developer.
🌱 I'm currently learning TypeScript + Tailwind.
📫 How to reach me: adrian.mamyto@gmail.com
🧑‍💻 I want to be a orchestra man, so I want to learn a lot of tech stacks, like PHP, C++, C#, Next.Js, Angular, Web3, Blockchain, etc.
🔮 In the future, I would like to try my hand at creating games, but for now I am focusing on improving my Web Developer skills.
⚡ Fun fact: When I programming, I listen all about geopolitics and Jazz.
